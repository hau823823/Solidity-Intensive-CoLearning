## Notes

### 2024.09.23
I will enjoy this Solidity learning journey going through one step by one step as a fresher.  It’s a chance to dive deeper into block-chain world, which lights me up so much. Wish I could learn and understand not only just the syntax, but also a big picture and the actual underlying concepts of how to program. 


This Solidity learning undertaking is divided into three steps in accordance with my goal in this 21-day journey:

Step1:  Initiation     5days 

* Going through overall 50 chapters and complete every test with a score of 100.

* Drawing at least four mind-map of the Solidity Tutorials.

* Marking difficulties and doubts of the tutorial details.

Step2:  Orientation   14days

* Summarizing and generalizing the learning difficulties in Step1.

* Categorizing of issues and details into different themes to learn.

* Learning the difficulties using QA way (answer at least two questions everyday).

Step3:  Summary    2 days

* Checking and filling the gaps in Step2.

* Figuring out all the test questions of WTF Academy .

* Mapping my own questions into a mind map.

### 2024.09.23

1. Finish looking through 15 chapters of Solidity 101 and complete the text.
   
2. Drawn the mindmap of Solidity 101.

3.Difficulties

Solidity is my first programming language, so the biggest challenge for me is the lack of programming mind. Without exaggeration, three steps one bug... Some sentences I couldn’t understand clearly even if I have read more than 10 times.

What's even sadder is that, despite it took me a long time to learn today. I have forgotten most of details in tutorials now. Thankfully, it doesn’t matter, I was ready for this situation. What really matters is what I could learn in this process.

It’s exactly a challenge for me cause I’m not only unfamiliar with Solidity, but also have few experience in writing English articles. However, I appreciate one sentence recently: If there are two ways to growth you can choose, always choose the one that’s harder, that's the direct way to get over it. 

This training camp can force myself to take Solidity and English writing tasks and face them directly, and it’s also a good opportunity to observe my own solutions and mindset in the face of difficulties and fears. Though I want to quit many times today, I'm sticking with it. It's a good begining.


### 2024.09.24

1. Looking through 15 chapters of Solidity 102 and complete the text.

3.Difficlties

Yesterday's difficulty is disappeared,cause I meet a bigger difficult today.Life is so fantastic.hhh

But I love and enjoy this feeling now,I have to concentrate on it and challenge myself in a short time.

In the long term, current temporary difficulty maybe not a bad thing, it's beneficial for the future.



And after learning in two days, I have a more clear goal about this 21-day Solidity Learning Journey:

Maybe I can be a translator in open source program first(If there is) after I master English terms in Coding,

Entering the blockchain world needs sustained effort，“Go the extra mile” it really really just a beginning.


### 2024.09.25

1.Looking through 7 chapters of Solidity 103 and complete the text.

3.Difficulties

Why I never marked specific question in tutorial details?

Excatly “questions mountain questions sea”hhh

This is my first time to learn coding deeply, it’s reasonable to meet various questions.

I need to keep calm down and find the interest where attracts me when I look through the tutorial. 

I find that many names of function is so casual and direct. it’s my fun today. Yahoo~ ~

### 2024.09.26

1.Looking through 7 chapters of Solidity 103 and complete the text.

3.Difficulties

On account of the more complicated chapters in Solidity 103, there are more definitions in the front of articles. 

So in the Step2, it is essential to figure out definitions by my own explanation. 

Which is useable to the understand the definition itself deeply and practice English coding terminology.

Fortunately，the structure of single article is more clearly and comcise, 

most of these are composed of definition, events, state variables, and functions，which have elaborate description in 101 and 102.

We learn them together can promote the understanding of framework, also, the differences and connections between them.
