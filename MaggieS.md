## Notes

<!-- Content_START -->

### 2024.09.23
I will enjoy this Solidity learning journey going through one step by one step as a fresher.  It’s a chance to dive deeper into block-chain world, which lights me up so much. Wish I could learn and understand not only just the syntax, but also a big picture and the actual underlying concepts of how to program. 


This Solidity learning undertaking is divided into three steps in accordance with my goal in this 21-day journey:

Step1:  Initiation     5days 

* Going through overall 50 chapters and complete every test with a score of 100.

* Drawing at least four mind-map of the Solidity Tutorials.

* Marking difficulties and doubts of the tutorial details.

Step2:  Orientation   14days

* Summarizing and generalizing the learning difficulties in Step1.

* Categorizing of issues and details into different themes to learn.

* Learning the difficulties using QA way (answer at least two questions everyday).

Step3:  Summary    2 days

* Checking and filling the gaps in Step2.

* Figuring out all the test questions of WTF Academy .

* Mapping my own questions into a mind map.

### 2024.09.23

1. Finish looking through 15 chapters of Solidity 101 and complete the text.
   
2. Drawn the mindmap of Solidity 101.

3.Difficulties

Solidity is my first programming language, so the biggest challenge for me is the lack of programming mind. Without exaggeration, three steps one bug... Some sentences I couldn’t understand clearly even if I have read more than 10 times.

What's even sadder is that, despite it took me a long time to learn today. I have forgotten most of details in tutorials now. Thankfully, it doesn’t matter, I was ready for this situation. What really matters is what I could learn in this process.

It’s exactly a challenge for me cause I’m not only unfamiliar with Solidity, but also have few experience in writing English articles. However, I appreciate one sentence recently: If there are two ways to growth you can choose, always choose the one that’s harder, that's the direct way to get over it. 

This training camp can force myself to take Solidity and English writing tasks and face them directly, and it’s also a good opportunity to observe my own solutions and mindset in the face of difficulties and fears. Though I want to quit many times today, I'm sticking with it. It's a good begining.


### 2024.09.24

1. Looking through 15 chapters of Solidity 102 and complete the text.

3.Difficlties

Yesterday's difficulty is disappeared,cause I meet a bigger difficult today.Life is so fantastic.hhh

But I love and enjoy this feeling now,I have to concentrate on it and challenge myself in a short time.

In the long term, current temporary difficulty maybe not a bad thing, it's beneficial for the future.



And after learning in two days, I have a more clear goal about this 21-day Solidity Learning Journey:

Maybe I can be a translator in open source program first(If there is) after I master English terms in Coding,

Entering the blockchain world needs sustained effort，“Go the extra mile” it really really just a beginning.


### 2024.09.25

1.Looking through 7 chapters of Solidity 103 and complete the text.

2.<img width="883" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0ea7885-eabd-4116-a7e6-532983dde339">

3.Difficulties

Why I never marked specific question in tutorial details?

Excatly “questions mountain questions sea”hhh

This is my first time to learn coding deeply, it’s reasonable to meet various questions.

I need to keep calm down and find the interest where attracts me when I look through the tutorial. 

I find that many names of function is so casual and direct. it’s my fun today. Yahoo~ ~

### 2024.09.26

1.Looking through 7 chapters of Solidity 103 and complete the text.

3.Difficulties

On account of the more complicated chapters in Solidity 103, there are more definitions in the front of articles. 

So in the Step2, it is essential to figure out definitions by my own explanation. 

Which is useable to the understand the definition itself deeply and practice English coding terminology.

Fortunately，the structure of single article is more clearly and comcise, 

most of these are composed of definition, events, state variables, and functions，which have elaborate description in 101 and 102.

We learn them together can promote the understanding of framework, also, the differences and connections between them.

### 2024.09.27

1. Looking through 7 chapters of Solidity 103 and complete the text.

3. Difficulties

In the fifth learning day, as the last step1 day, we have learned overall 50 chapters. 

However, it’s just a new beginning of Step2, there is still lots of room for development. 

We need more enough time and space to promote coding and English terminology skills. 

Fortunately,the second part, can be modularized according to the relationship between chapters in the tutorials,

which is not only more convenient for memory and understanding, but also more convenient for logical sorting.

Just Like:

45 Time lock —— 22 Call

46 Proxy Contract —— 22 Call —— 23 Delegatecall —— Lesson 27: ABI encoding 

47 Upgradeable Contract —— 46  Proxy Contract

48 Transparent Proxy ——29 Function Selectors

49 UUPS  —— 23 Delegatecall

50 Multisignature Wallet —— 27 ABI encoding 


### 2024.09.28

Actually, the function of Language is for communication, no matter the natural language or programming language. In other words, a technology is just a solution, and a solution is only as good as the problems, so we need to make sure we know the problem really well, so we know how to attack it with this smart contract technology.

By the way, It’s a person who gives me huge passions to challenge solidity this time , she is a female security auditor. I remember what she said in a interview that before she intended the ZK audit competition she even never learn ZK language, she just use few days to familiar with ZK language, but she got the champion, soooo fantastic.

I try to find the crucial reason in Step 2 which confusing me for a long time that why and how she could make done it. So it must be something more important than language itself, language is just a language. No one knows whether I will be the solidity auditor in the future. It's a black box, which is interesting. But I'm sure this is not the most important thing.

I know what I’m appreciate and chase for, learning solidity is just a experience to understand something to serve my life goals. Solidity itself is not my goal.

Q1: 
<img width="777" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0655440-5342-4d36-b991-33f635506990">

Where is the bug of this picture in coding Hello Web3 ?

Though it said there are some bugs here, but I believe that "Code is law". 

A bug is just a bug, it will not exist forever,be relaxed. 

If the bug is fixed today, it will only affect yesterday.

I believe very strongly, someday, the web3 will change the world. 

At that time, I will smile and say "hello web3",welcome to our world.


This answer will be written again later after this bug has fixed.
The most easist coding maybe not so easy, When I copied tutorial's example,it's correct,
When I wrote by myself, it said there are errors, but I couldn't distinguish they have any diffenence.

Q2:
How Does Solidity Work?

1. Public and Private Functions
In Solidity, functions are the building blocks of smart contracts.
Some functions can be accessed from outside the contract (public),
while others are only available within the contract (private).

2. Standard and Code Logic
Solidity follows a set of rules and logic similar to other programming languages.
The behavior of a smart contract is determined by the functions and conditions defined in the code.

3. Immutability
Once deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, a smart contract becomes immutable,meaning its code and behavior cannot be changed.
This ensures the contract’s transparency and security, as participants can trust that the contract will always function as intended.

4. Gas Costs
When interacting with smart contracts on Ethereum, users must pay for the computational power used during the execution of functions. This payment is done using “gas.” Each operation within the contract consumes a specific amount of gas and users need to provide enough gas to complete the transaction.

5. Data Types
Solidity has different types of data that can be used, such as numbers, addresses, true/false values, text, arrays, and more.

6. Control Structures
Solidity provides tools to control how the program behaves, such as conditional statements (if-else), loops (for, while), and switches.

7. Modifiers
Modifiers are like rules that we can apply to functions. They allow us to add extra checks or behaviors to functions.

8. Events
Events allow contracts to communicate with external applications. They are like messages that can be logged on the blockchain and listened to by other programs.


### 2024.09.30

One benefit of learning solidity is to be calm down. Rome was not built in a day.

I am a soooo lucky girl that Web3 is willing to love, protect and support me.  

But it is precisely because I cherish this luck that we should take our time.  

I also need to improve my ability in all aspects if one day Web3 needs me.  


Someday he needs me, I can stand up and protect him. I know I can do it.

But the premise is that I must go through enough tempering and growth.

Is there a better opportunity than I can survive the hardest time alone?

Maybe he would say he doesn't need it, but, I have to have this ability.



Q1: If you want to be a solidity security auditor, what aspects do their safety reports include？

A well-structured security audit report enables readers to grasp the key findings and recommendations quickly. 
Consider incorporating the following components to achieve a clear, concise, and informative report:

Executive Summary: Provide a high-level overview of the audit’s objectives, scope, methodology, and main findings, catering to non-technical decision-makers.

Detailed Findings: Present an in-depth analysis of specific vulnerabilities, risks, and security issues identified during the audit.

Risk Assessment: Quantify and prioritize the risks associated with each finding, helping stakeholders focus on the most significant areas.

Recommendations: Offer actionable insights and remediation strategies tailored to the organization’s needs, resources, and goals.

Conclusion: Summarize key takeaways and emphasize the value of addressing the identified risks and implementing the proposed recommendations.


Q2: If you want to be a solidity security auditor,  to what extent should you learn solidity?

There are so many details about Solidity in security audit reports,just like:

1. Hardcoded Address:

contracts/ComptrollerG4.sol [1379, 1433]
The contract contains unknown address. This address might be used for some malicious activity.
Please check hardcoded address and it's usage.

Recommendation:
It is required to check the address. Also, it is required to check the code of the called
contract for vulnerabilities.

2. Multiplication after division

Solidity operates only with integers. Thus, if the division is done before the
multiplication, the rounding errors can increase dramatically.
● contracts/DAIInterestRateModelV3.sol [line: 83-86]
● contracts/DAIInterestRateModelV3.sol [line: 94-94]

Recommendation:
Multiplication before division may increase the rounding precision.

3.  Locked money
   
● contracts/Unitroller.sol [Line 10-148]
Contracts programmed to receive ether should implement a way to withdraw it, i.e., call
transfer (recommended), send, or call.value at least once.

Recommendation:
Implement a withdraw function or reject payments (contracts without a fallback function
do it automatically).

4. msg.value == 0 check
   
● contracts/CErc20Delegator.sol [Line: 453-453]
The msg.value == 0 condition check is meaningless in most cases.

Recommendation:
Avoid meaningless checks


### 2024.10.01

I recognize that I'm still a Solidity Baby.

Answer the questions later. GN~

It is easy to have ambiguity when discussing some topics in this way.  

I mean, I have seen the picture that solidity was so cute when he was a child.  

I'm willing to witness and company, the growth of some little solidity, again.


Q1:If you want to be a solidity security auditor, to what extent should you learn solidity(2.0)?
There are so many details about Solidity in security audit reports,just like:

5.Unsafe array's length manipulation 

● contracts/ComptrollerG4.sol [Line: 220-220] 
● contracts/Comptroller.sol [Line: 226-226 ] 
● contracts/ComptrollerG2.sol [Line: 220-220 ] 
● contracts/ComptrollerG3.sol [Line: 220-220 ] 
● contracts/ComptrollerG1.sol [Line: 224-224 ] 

The length of the dynamic array is changed directly. In this case, the appearance of gigantic arrays is possible and it can lead to a storage overlap attack (collisions with other data in storage). Recommendation If possible, avoid changing the length of the dynamic array directly. 

● Use uint[] storage arrayName = new uint[](7) to create a dynamic array of the desired length. 
● Use delete arrayName to clear a dynamic array. 
● Use .push() (instead of .length++) to write to the end of the dynamic array. 
● Starting with version 0.5.0 of the Solidity compiler, use .pop() (instead of .length--) to delete the last element of the dynamic array.

6.Using approve function of the ERC-20 token standard 

The approve function of ERC-20 is vulnerable. Using front-running attack one can spend approved tokens before change of allowance value. 
● contracts/CErc20Delegator.sol [line: 183-186] 
● contracts/CToken.sol [line: 158-163] 

Recommendation: Only use the approve function of the ERC-20 standard to change the allowed amount to 0 or from 0 (wait till transaction is mined and approved).

7.Extra gas consumption 

State variable, .balance, or .length of non-memory array is used in the condition of for or while loop. In this case, every iteration of loop consumes extra gas. 

● contracts/Governance/GovernorAlpha.sol [line: 210-212, 180-182, 196,198] 
● contracts/ComptrollerG4.sol [line: 1018-1020] 
● contracts/Lens/CompoundLens.sol [line: 230-253, 301-306,] 
● contracts/Comptroller.sol [Line: 1034-1036] 

Recommendation: If a state variable, .balance, or .length is used several times, holding its value in a local variable is more gas efficient. If .length of calldata-array is placed into a local variable, the optimisation will be less significant.

8.Overpowered role 

● contracts/SimplePriceOracle.sol [Line: 44-47, 25-42] 

This function is callable only from one address. Therefore, the system depends heavily on this address. In this case, there are scenarios that may lead to undesirable consequences for investors, e.g. if the private key of this address becomes compromised. 

Recommendation We recommend designing contracts in a trustless manner. For instance, this functionality can be implemented in the contract's constructor. Another option is to use MultiSig wallet at this address.

9.Compiler version not fixed 

Solidity source files indicate the versions of the compiler they can be compiled with. 

pragma solidity ^0.4.17; // bad: compiles w 0.4.17 and above 
pragma solidity 0.4.24; // good : compiles w 0.4.24 only 

It is recommended to follow the latter example, as future compiler versions may handle certain language constructions in a way the developer did not foresee. 

Recommendation: Specify the exact compiler version (pragma solidity x.y.z;).

Q2: What is the purpose of security audit ?

The focus of the audit is to verify whether the smart contract is secure, resilient, and working properly according to the specs. The audit activity can be grouped in three categories. Security: Identifying the security-related issue within each contract and system of contracts. Sound architecture: Evaluating the architect of a system through the lens of established smart contract best practice and general software practice. Code correctness and quality: A full review of contract source code. The primary area of focus includes. 

● Correctness. 
● Section of code with high complexity. 
● Readability. 
● Quantity and quality of test coverage.
